-- As usual for configs, playing multiplayer will require all players to have the same config as the server.

-- How much power a factory or power plant can store
-- Note: If this value is set too small relative to the power limits, then this will lower the effective power limits.
factorissimo.config.power_buffer = "10MJ"

-- How much power can enter a factory
factorissimo.config.power_input_limit = "50MW"

-- How much of the power sent into a factory arrives inside
-- 1 means lossless transfer, 0 means no power arrives inside at all.
factorissimo.config.power_input_multiplier = 1.0

-- How much power can leave a power plant
factorissimo.config.power_output_limit = "500MW"

-- How much of the power produced in a power plant arrives outside
-- 1 means lossless transfer, 0 means no power arrives outside at all.
factorissimo.config.power_output_multiplier = 1.0

-- Daytime in factories (2 is always day, 1 is regular day/night, 0 is always night)
-- After changing configs, load your game and visit all existing factories to automatically update their daytimes

-- How much of the pollution inside arrives outside
-- 1 means all pollution inside is transferred outside, 0 means all pollution inside is destroyed.
-- 2 means pollution is doubled!
factorissimo.config.pollution_multiplier = 1.0

-- Factories inside other factories!
-- 0 means no recursion at all is allowed
-- 1 means that buildings only work inside higher-tier buildings (more factory tiers will be released in future updates)
-- 2 means that buildings only work inside higher-tier or equal-tier buildings
-- 3 means you can place any building inside any other!
-- Note: Changing this config will not prevent you from *placing* factories anywhere. However if you place factories where they are not supposed to be, they will simply not work and not connect to anything, and you won't be able to enter them.
-- Another note: Changing this config mid-game will not disconnect preexisting wrongly nested factories, but it will prevent you from entering them. To be able to enter such interior factories again, just mine them and place them back down in the overworld.

-- Maximum factory size
-- 0: Small (6X6) only
-- 1: Small and medium (12X12)
